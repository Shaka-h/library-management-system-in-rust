Here’s a breakdown of each module and its responsibilities in the Library Management System:

---

### **1. `author` Module**

The `author` module is responsible for defining and managing authors in the library system. Its primary role is to encapsulate the attributes and basic methods related to an `Author`.

- **Data Structure**:
  - `Author`: Stores author information with fields like `id` (a unique identifier) and `name`.

- **Methods**:
  - `new`: A constructor that initializes an `Author` with a unique ID and a name.
  
**Purpose**: This module allows us to create and manage authors independently, which is useful for associating books with specific authors and retrieving them later by the author.

---

### **2. `book` Module**

The `book` module is responsible for defining and managing books within the library system. This module is central to the system since books are the main resource patrons interact with.

- **Data Structures**:
  - `Status` (enum): Indicates the current state of a book, either `Available` or `CheckedOut`.
  - `Book`: Contains book information like `id`, `title`, `author`, and `status`.

- **Methods**:
  - `new`: A constructor that initializes a `Book` with a unique ID, title, associated author, and a default status of `Available`.

**Purpose**: This module provides structure for creating, managing, and tracking the availability of books in the library. It also uses the `Author` type, tying books and authors together, which demonstrates Rust’s ownership and borrowing concepts.

---

### **3. `patron` Module**

The `patron` module defines and manages patrons, or users, of the library system. Patrons are key actors who borrow and return books, so this module is focused on managing the relationships between patrons and books.

- **Data Structure**:
  - `Patron`: Represents a library user with fields for `id`, `name`, and a vector (`Vec<u32>`) of borrowed book IDs.

- **Methods**:
  - `new`: A constructor to initialize a `Patron` with a unique ID and name.
  - `borrow_book`: Adds a book ID to the patron’s list of borrowed books.
  - `return_book`: Removes a book ID from the list when a book is returned.

**Purpose**: This module provides mechanisms for tracking which books a patron has borrowed and handles book return operations. It also demonstrates Rust’s mutable references and borrowing concepts when updating a patron’s borrowed book list.

---

### **4. `library` Module**

The `library` module acts as the main orchestrator of the system, managing all interactions between books, authors, and patrons. It implements the core logic of adding and tracking entities and handling book checkouts and returns.

- **Data Structure**:
  - `Library`: Contains `HashMap`s for storing books, authors, and patrons by their unique IDs. This structure allows quick lookups and efficient management of the data.

- **Methods**:
  - `new`: Initializes an empty `Library`.
  - `add_author`: Adds an author to the `authors` map.
  - `add_book`: Adds a book to the `books` map.
  - `register_patron`: Registers a new patron in the `patrons` map.
  - `borrow_book`: Allows a patron to borrow a book, marking it as `CheckedOut` if available and adding the book ID to the patron’s borrowed list.
  - `return_book`: Allows a patron to return a borrowed book, updating the book status to `Available` and removing the book ID from the patron’s borrowed list.

**Purpose**: This module coordinates interactions and maintains the system's integrity by enforcing business rules, such as checking a book’s availability before a patron can borrow it. This module uses Rust’s ownership model to ensure each book and patron is managed safely and effectively.

---

### **5. `main.rs`**

The `main.rs` file ties everything together. It initializes the library, adds authors, books, and patrons, and tests out various operations.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Instantiates a `Library` object.
  - Calls methods on the `Library` to demonstrate adding, borrowing, and returning books.
  - Acts as an entry point for running the program.

**Purpose**: `main.rs` serves as the interface for running the library management system, providing a playground for testing out functionality and demonstrating module interactions.

Each module plays a specific role in the system, encapsulating functionality to make the system modular, organized, and maintainable. Together, they provide a full-featured library management system that makes use of Rust's strengths in ownership, borrowing, and type safety.
